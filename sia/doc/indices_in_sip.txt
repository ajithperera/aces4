BlockId is an index into the array table + a MAXDIM sized array values that identify the block.
Given the Id, we can compute the shape using the segment table and the 
Block has an Id and a possibly null pointer to data
BlockSelector is an array of sial indices, represented by their index into the index table.  A selector
can be turned into an ID by pairing it with a compatible array, and getting the current values of the index.
a[i,j] = b[k,l]

Index VALUES are visible in sial.
j = 1,4
k= 5,9
Index SELECTORS are not, and start at 0.
