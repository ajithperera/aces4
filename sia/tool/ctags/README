Adds CTAGS support for SIAL.

CTAGS in the Build System
-------------------------
In your BUILD directory, say "make ctags". The "tags" file will be generated. 
In vi (or VIM), set the tags file in .vimrc or in the command mode by saying set tags=/path/to/tags.

CTAGS using your own .ctags file
--------------------------------
You can also use the provided ctags file. Copy its contents to ~/.ctags, then say "ctags -R" in the base source directory to create the "tags" file.
