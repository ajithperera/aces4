 *
 * After a worker sends a message that should be acked, it invokes
 * expect_ack_from with the rank of the server and the tag.
 * This posts an asynchronous receive for the ack and saves the
 * request internally.
 *
 * At a barrier, the wait_all method returns when all of the acks have
 * been received.
 *
 * The cleanup method may be called at any time to remove requests for acks that
 * have already arrived from the array of pending requests.  It will be
 * called if the array of pending requests becomes full.
