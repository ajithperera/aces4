To convert files to new SIAL syntax:

1. copy jar file to directory containing files
Sialx1toSialx2.jar

2.  Run the following bash script
for sialfile in *.sialx; do java -jar  Sialx1toSialx2.jar $sialfile; done

This leaves the original files intact and creates new ones called *.temp
If it looks like all is well, delete the originals and rename the new ones

rm *.sialx
for sialfile in *.temp; do mv "$sialfile" "${sialfile%.temp}.sialx"; done


Note:  comments are not touched, so commented out code may need to be manually changed if it is uncommented later.
