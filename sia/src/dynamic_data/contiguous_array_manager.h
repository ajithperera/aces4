/*
 * contiguous_array_manager.h
 *
 * Classes in this file manage a map containing contiguous arrays.  Currently,
 * these should be predefined before the SIAL program starts, i.e. should be declared
 * in the SIAL program as static.
 *
 * Contiguous arrays are used in two ways:  as one large block containing the entire array, and
 * as subblocks.  Methods are provided for both situations.
 *
 * Only entire contiguous arrays are stored in the map.
 *
 * Subblocks are supported by copying the elements belonging to a subblock into a
 * contiguous subblock.  This can then be handled by super instructions and the
 * interpreter in the same way that other blocks are handled.  If the block is modified,
 * it must be copied back into the enclosing contiguous block.  A WriteBack object is
 * provided to the interpreter, which is responsible for determining when the write-back should occur.
 * Note that this approach may not have the correct semantics if the same block is
 * handled multiple times in one super instruction, and aliases are created:
 * for example execute si a[i,j] a[i,j].  Thus the compiler does not allow the same
 * contigous array to appear in multiple arguments unless all are reads.
